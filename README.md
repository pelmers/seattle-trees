Source code for web site which shows all the street trees in Seattle on a
mobile-friendly map (rendered with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)). Tapping
any tree icon brings up a summary of its Wikipedia article using
[MeaningCloud](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/apis).

Street tree data is sourced from SDOT's
[Urban Forestry Map](https://seattlecitygis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=a7072ffa326c4ef39a0f031961ebace6).

Note that this repo doesn't include the data directly, see instructions for
downloading it in `res/README.md`.
